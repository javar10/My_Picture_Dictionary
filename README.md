Create a picture dictionary in Andriod Studio. 

# Project Description :pencil:
One tool that educators have to support the vocabulary development of language learners is a picture dictionary. While a very useful tool, these static dictionaries often fall short in providing relevant information. My Picture Dictionary is a dynamic, personal picture dictionary where users can add words of interest. Simply search for words or phrases in any supported language and the dictionary will store words in the target language with an accompanying image of their choice. 

# Under Construction :construction: 
<ul>
  <li>
    Google Translate API - user can choose from supported language for their dictionary and input
  </li>
  <li>
    Image Search - using Kiddle.co image search, users can choose the image to add to their dictionary
  </li>
  <li>
    Dictionary Sorting - in addition to an alphabetical sort, users will be able to sort based on category
  </li>
</ul>
